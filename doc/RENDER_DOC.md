## Render Key features

Render key features are as follows:

1.  **Oral Translation Workflow**: the translation process involves
    speaking, recording, and reviewing translations performed step by
    step.

2.  **Collaboration for quality control**: several people can work
    together on the translation to gain better translation results

3.  **User-Friendly Interface:** Render supports 16 languages (Arabic, Bengali, Dzongkha, English, Spanish, French, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Lao, Nepali, Portugal, Russian, Swahili, Tamil, Vietnamese). In addition, Render uses its own pictogram language to make translation process easy and clear even without reading.

# Key Terms

**Project** is a set of work to be translated. Each Project has its own
workflow, users, and sections to translate.

**Source Language** is a language which the translation is done from.
The Project can have from one to four Source Languages.

**Target Language** is a language which the translation is done to. The
Project can have one and only Target Language.

## What to Translate?

**Project Scope** is a list of Sections to be translated.

**Section** is several verses of the Bible united by one main idea.
Section is the main translation unit in Render. Section consists of one
or more Passages.

**Passage** is a chunk within the larger context of a Section to be
translated.

**Segment** is a small part of a Passage to be back translated.

**Reference** is a predefined recording of the Section on a Source
Language.

**Draft** is a recording of a Section on the Target Language made by a
User.

**Note** is a small clarification statement placed on the recording.

## Who to Translate?

**User** is someone who relates to the project, can track its progress,
and typically, assigned to do some work to contribute to translation.

***Global User*** is someone who has the rights to Configure and/or to
make the final approval for the Section. Global Users are predefined for
a Project. Global Users have access to multiple Projects they are
assigned to.

***Render User*** is someone who is able to perform any translation work
except the final approval for the Section. Render Users are created for
the Project. Render Users have access only to the Project they are
created into.

## How to Translate?

**Project Workflow (Workflow)** is a sequence of steps to be performed
for the Project to translate and verify the result.

**Stage** is a step or a bunch of steps of translating and reviewing in
the Project Workflow.

**Substage** is a step in the Stage for either translate or review

# Getting Started

To start working in Render, the following actions are needed:

1.  Add a Project.

2.  Create Project Workflow.

3.  Create Users who will work on the Project.

4.  Assign Users to Substages.

## How to add a Project?

There are several ways how to add a Project to Render 3:

1.  Add via Project ID

2.  Add from Project List

3.  Add from Computer (USB device)

### Adding via Project ID

To add a Project via Project ID the following steps should be performed:

1.  Insure you are connected to the web or to another device. To do so,
    please, go to the **How to Establish Connection**
    chapter.

2.  **Get Project ID**: Project ID is set when the Project is created.
    Typically, Project IDs are distributed between teammates. Ask your
    teammate or Project coordinator to share the Project ID with you.
    Projects are created in Launchpad which is a separate tool for
    Project and User management created by Hossana.

3.  In Render 3 **click 'Add Project via ID' button** (on Login screen
    or on Project List screen).

4.  Type in or **insert your Project ID to the input field and click on
    the 'Add Project' button**. Note: please, do NOT change anything in the Project ID format.

    a.  In case Render 3 recognizes Project ID, the Project adding process will be started.

    b.  In case Render 3 does not recognize the Project ID, the following message will be displayed: *Improperly formatted ID. Please re-enter it.*\
    **Troubleshooting**: Please, make sure the Project ID typed is the one that has been shared.

5.  After Render 3 finishes data transfer, it will show the result:

    a.  In case all data has been received successfully, **Success** screen will be displayed.\
    That means the User can start working on this Project on the current device.

    b.  In case an error has occurred, Error screen will be displayed.\
    **Troubleshooting**: Please, add the Project again.

### Adding a Project from Project List

To add a Project from Project List the following steps should be performed:
**Note**: Only **Global Users** can add a Project from the Project list.

1.  Insure you are connected to the web or to another device. To do so, please, go to the **How to Establish Connection** chapter.

2.  Login to Render with your credentials.\
    In case there are no Projects downloaded for this User, you are redirected to Project List screen Add New tab.\
    In case there is at least one Project for this User, you are redirected inside the Project.

3.  Go to the 'Project List' screen 'Add New' tab.

4.  Click the 'Add' button on the tile of the Project to be downloaded.\
    In case the download has been started, Render displays the 'Adding' spinner near the 'Add' button.\
    In case nothing has happened, please, check your internet connection.

5.  When the Project is added, the 'Added' check-mark is displayed instead of the 'Add' button.

**For p.2:**

In case Render shows constant error message while logging in, please, do
the following:

-   Assure you are online,

-   Assure your credentials are valid,

-   Assure you are a Global User.

In case there is no Projects on Project list screen, please, do the
following:

-   Assure you are assigned to a Project.

-   All Projects you are assigned to have already been downloaded.

### Add from Computer (USB device)

The functionality will be added later.

### How can I enter the Project

1\. Assure there is at least one Project downloaded (at least one
Project is displayed on the 'Project List' tab of the 'Project List'
screen).\
In case there is no Project displayed on the 'Project List' tab of the 'Project List' screen, please, follow the instructions on **How to add a Project**.

2\. Click on the Project name.

## How to create Project Workflow

### How can I translate in Render?

For the Section to sound properly in a Target Language, it should
translate from a Source Language and review. To do that in the right
way, Render comes up with the idea of a Project Workflow that consists
of Stages (please refer to [Key Terms](#key-terms)).

The minimum number of Stages in the Project Workflow is two, the maximum
number of Stages is unlimited.

There are five Stage types that can be added to a Project workflow:

-   **Draft Stage** is the Stage where the first Draft is recorded from a Source Language to the Target Language. This Stage is a must and always goes the first one on the Project Workflow.

-   **Peer Check** **Stage** is the Stage where the Draft is reviewed and re-recorded if needed. This Stage is optional.

-   **Community Check Stage** is the Stage where retelling in the Target Language is recorded, and questions are left**.** In case the Draft needs adjustments, the Draft can be re-recorded. This Stage is optional.

-   **Consultant Check Stage** is the Stage where the Draft is back translated to Source Language for reviewing purposes. In case the Draft needs adjustments, the Draft can be re-recorded. This Stage is optional.\
    ***Note:*** It is recommended to use one and only Consultant Check
    Stage per Project Workflow.

-   **Consultant Approval Stage** is the Stage where the Draft is
    approved as Done. This Stage is a must and always goes the last one
    on the Project Workflow.

Each optional Stage has its own configurable Substages:

-   Peer Check Stage incorporates the following Substages:

    -   Peer Check Substage where the review of a Draft occurs,

    -   Peer Revise Substage where the User can change the Draft based
        on the comments posted on Peer Check Substage.

-   Community Test Stage has the following Substages:

    -   Community Setup Substage where the Users can add questions to a
        specific Draft part,

    -   Community Test Substage where the User retells the Draft in the
        target language on their own words and answers to the questions
        posted on Community Setup,

    -   Community Revise Substage where the User can change the Draft
        based on the comments posted on Community Test Stage.

-   Consultant Check Stage includes the following Substages:

    -   Back Translate Substage (for Passage and Segment) where the User
        translates the Draft back to Source Language,

    -   Transcribe Substage where the User adds text representation of
        Back Translations,

    -   Note Interpret Substage (to Consultant and to Translator
        separately) where the User records translation of Notes to the
        Source Language,

    -   Consultant Check Substage where the User reviews all work done
        for Consultant Check Stage,

    -   Consultant Revise Substage where the User can change the Draft
        based on the comments posted on Consultant Check Stage.

### How can I access my work items?

Substages are represented as icons on the Project Home screen.

In case there is no work for a Substage, the Substage icon's color is
light gray. You cannot enter Substage if there is no work to do.

In case there is no work for Consultant Check Substage or Consultant
Approval Substage, icons for the Substages are dark grey. You can enter
the Substage and see the Sections for review.

In case there is a work to perform for a Substage, the Substage icon
color is yellow. You can enter the Substage by clicking on the Substage
icon.

To access the Substage, click the Substage icon.

### How can I track the Translation Progress for my Project?

To track translation progress for the Project perform the following
steps:

1.  Open three-dot menu

2.  Click Section Status

On the 'Processes' tab all Sections are organized under several
categories:

-   **Unassigned** group incorporates the Sections not assigned to be
    translated.

-   **StageName** group represents the Section on the Substage it places
    now.

-   **Approved** group gathers the Sections which have been approved by
    the Consultant and on which translation-review work is fully
    completed.

### Can I start over Translation Progress on the Section?

Yes, you can. There are two types of restarting:

-   'Reset Section' means to start Section translation from scratch,

-   'Restore Section' means to start Section translation from the Stage
    selected by the User.

Admin (Configure) only can restart work on the Section.

### Can I create Draft by multiple Users?

No, the Draft cannot be recorded by multiple Users in Render. Otherwise, a Draft Conflict is detected.
Admin (Configure) only can resolve the Draft Conflict for the Section.

## Create Users who will work on the Project.

### Who is a User?

The User in Render is someone who can see the Project Data.
There are two types of Users:

- Global users (Configure, Consultant) are predefined User with extended permissions:

- Configure User is a Project Admin and can configure Project parameters in Render as well as restore and reset Sections

- Consultant User is the one who approves the Section translation as finished.

Both User types can be assigned to any Substage in the Project Workflow. 

Please, note that Consultant Global User can be assigned to Consultant Approval Stage. 

## Assign Users to Substages

### How to assign a User to work

For assigning a User to some work, the following should be done: 

Assure the Project Workflow is configured properly and all substages needed are activated, 

1. Assure all Users needed are added to the Project, 

2. Click the ‘Assign Users’ icon on the ’Configure’ tab of the ‘Project Home’ screen, 

3. Drag the Username and drop it to the Substage needed. 
4. Now the User is assigned to the Substage. 

For some Stages (Draft, Peer Check, and Community Test stages) there is a ‘Team’ concept. 

That means the translation work can be done in parallel to speed up the result. 

In case the User is assigned to a Substage, they will see the substage icon on the Project Home screen after they log in. 

### How to unassign a User to work
